comments - last inserted ID. or extract latest inserted id then use it in your script to display the latest comments on top. 

PHP MYADMIN SQL TESTINGS:

### target comments 
SELECT comments.comment FROM comments
INNER JOIN client_exp_comment ON comments.id = client_exp_comment.comments_fk
INNER JOIN client_exp ON client_exp.id = client_exp_comment.client_exp_fk

SELECT * FROM work_exp
INNER JOIN client_exp ON work_exp.id = client_exp.id 
WHERE work_exp.job_category = "Arts, Audio/Video Technology and Communications"

SELECT * FROM work_exp
INNER JOIN client_exp ON work_exp.id = client_exp.id
INNER JOIN job_category_list ON work_exp.job_category = job_category_list.id
WHERE work_exp.job_category = 2
