comments - last inserted ID. or extract latest inserted id then use it in your script to display the latest comments on top. 

PHP MYADMIN SQL TESTINGS:

### target comments 
SELECT comments.comment FROM comments
INNER JOIN client_exp_comment ON comments.id = client_exp_comment.comments_fk
INNER JOIN client_exp ON client_exp.id = client_exp_comment.client_exp_fk

--> the above returns two results. unsure why. 

### retrieve all experiences by both:

SELECT * FROM work_exp
INNER JOIN client_exp ON work_exp.id = client_exp.id 
WHERE work_exp.job_category = "Arts, Audio/Video Technology and Communications"

SELECT * FROM work_exp
INNER JOIN client_exp ON work_exp.id = client_exp.id
INNER JOIN job_category_list ON work_exp.job_category = job_category_list.id
WHERE work_exp.job_category = 2

##LAST_INSERT_ID()

INSERT INTO age_range (age_group) VALUES ("0-4")

INSERT INTO client_age (client_age) VALUES (id of client_exp just created)

INSERT INTO client_age (age_age) VALUES (id of the age_group just created)

INSERT INTO client_exp (id, title, details, date) VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(work_exp), "wonderful client", "we sat down and talked for 30mins about our common interests before moving to the business aspects of things.", 20191010);


##retrieve the auto incremented id from database and insert into client_age




SELECT * FROM age_range
INNER JOIN client_age ON client_age.age_age = age_range.id
INNER JOIN client_exp ON client_age.client_age = client_exp.id
